# Ball Miner

A simple game I made to learn Odin. Overall I had a good time. You're a spiky ball, tasked with mining as many ores as you can. Bounce against the ores to mine them, but beware! If you fall out of the mine, you lose. To continue, you have to make it to the portal in every mine. Keep going to get the highscore!

If you want to better understand the code, the DeepWiki, while not perfect, is quite accurate (yes I've looked over it myself). You can find it here: https://deepwiki.com/abyssaltheking/ball_miner
