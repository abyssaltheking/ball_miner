# Ball Miner

A simple game I made to learn Odin. Overall I had a good time. You're a spiky ball, tasked with mining as many ores as you can. Bounce against the ores to mine them, but beware! If you fall out of the mine, you lose. To continue, you have to make it to the portal in every mine. Keep going to get the highscore!
